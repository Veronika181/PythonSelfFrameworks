In Rahul Shetty's Selenium WebDriver with Python course continuation on Udemy, I learned about:

1.End-to-End Testing: Comprehensive testing with Selenium.
2.Page Object Design Pattern: Structured approach for maintainability.
3.Flexibility: Dynamic browser selection via command line.
4.Data-Driven Testing: Parameterizing tests with different data sets.
5.Custom Utilities: Developing utility functions for testing.
6.Logging and Reporting: Integrating logging and generating reports.
These cover advanced techniques for building robust test suites.
